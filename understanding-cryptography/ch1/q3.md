## Given

- the ASIC can check $5Ã—10^8$ per second.
- total budget: $1 million
- cost of 1 ASIC: $50
- age of universe: $10^{10}$ years
- according to the Moor's Law, every 18 month the computing power doubles and the cost stays the same
- 

## Questions 

1. how many ASIC can run in parallel?
2. how does an average key search will take?
3. How many years do we have to wait until a key-search machine can be built for breaking AES with 128 bit with an average search time of 24 hours? 
  
## Answers
### 1
$$
\frac{10^6}{50} = \frac{2 \times 10^6}{10^2} = 2 \times 10^4
$$

20,000 ASICs can be run in parallel
### 2
$$
2^{128} keys =
2 \times 10^4 ASIC \times \frac{5 \times 10^8keys}{1\ second.ASIC} \times T
\\
T = \frac{2^{128}}{10^{15}} = \frac{1024^{12.8}}{10^{15}} = \frac{10^{3\times12.8}}{10^{15}} = 10^{38.4-15} \simeq 10^{23} seconds
\\
T = 10^{23}\ second \times \frac{1 hour}{3600\ second} \times \frac{1\ day}{24\ hour} \times \frac{1 year}{365\ day} = \frac{10^{23}}{3.1536 \times 10^7} \sim 10^{15} year
$$

according to the calculations, a key search at most will take $10^{15}$ years!!
on average optimistically it is $10^{14}$ years which still is not doable in this universe ...

### 3
$$
2^{128} keys =
2 \times 10^4 ASIC \times \frac{2^P \times 5 \times 10^8keys}{1\ second.ASIC} \times 24\ hour \times \frac{3600\ second}{1 hour}
\\
2^{128} = 10^{17} \times 24 \times 36 \times 2^P
\\
P \simeq  \log_{2}{\frac{2^{128}}{10^{20}}} = 128 - 60 = 68
$$
we have to wait 68 periods or $18\times68=1224$ months or $102$ years.
