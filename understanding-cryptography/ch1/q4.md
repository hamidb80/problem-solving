$$
key\ space = 2^{7 \times 8} = 2^{56}
$$

## 2 

there are 2 possibilities:
1. each letter is stored in 8 bits (1 byte), then the key length is $8*8=64$
2. each letter is stored in 8 bits (although unusual) then the key length is $7*8=56$

## 3
the key length is the same since the behaviour of *most* users does not define the key length.

## 4

### in case of 7-bit characters
$$
128 = 7 \times L \Rightarrow L = \left\lceil \frac{128}{7} \right\rceil = 19
$$

### in case of 26 letters
$$
128 = \left\lceil\log_2 26  \right\rceil \times L \Rightarrow L = \left\lceil \frac{128}{5} \right\rceil = 26
$$
