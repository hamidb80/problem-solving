# Prove failure of brute force against OTP
Explain exactly why an exhaustive key search (brute force) againt OTP will not succeed even though sufficient computational resources are available.


# Answer

## Mine
assume brute force againt OTP will succeed, i.e. can determine the next key bit. we know that the key is produced using TRNG (True Random Number Generator) and hence and past key bits does not depend on new key bit. this is contradiction

## DeepSeek AI :/

Assume brute force against OTP will succeed, i.e., the attacker can determine the correct plaintext.

However, because the key is truly random and used only once, every possible plaintext is equally likely to be the correct one.

This means the attacker gains no information about the plaintext, even after trying all possible keys.

Therefore, brute force cannot succeed against an OTP, even with unlimited computational resources.
