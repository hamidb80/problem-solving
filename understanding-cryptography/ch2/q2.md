# OTP Issues

1. life cycle of the key:
it can be used once, hence the name "one time" pad

2. storage of the key during the life cycle the life cycle
both parties have to store all 1Gb key

3. storage of the key after the life cycle,
its useless and can be wiped out

4. key distribution
it must be transfered over a secure network or physical co-location 

5. generation of the key
the only thing the producer of the key must consider is that is should not follow any predicable pattern, that is it should feel completely random
